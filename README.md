These blog posts are instructions I wrote to myself. The best posts are:

* [Abstracting JavaScript](https://github.com/tdkehoe/blog/wiki/Abstracting-JavaScript) - A blog post about starting without abstractions, then adding first-order abstraction (a _for_ loop), then adding second-order abstraction (a nested _for_ loop). When a bug is encountered, you step down to the previous level of abstraction and the bug becomes obvious.
* [MEAN CRUD](https://github.com/tdkehoe/blog/wiki/MEAN-CRUD) - The 2500-word instructions I wrote for myself while studying for the CRUD exam. I used these instructions to build the [jobsly](https://github.com/tdkehoe/jobsly) app.

# How To Write Wiki Pages

I set this as a public wiki, so anyone should be able to write or edit pages. 

Just click the "Edit" or "New Page" buttons. You can write in Markdown or HTML. Markdown is simple enough except for code. You have to indent lines of code four or more spaces...and the Markdown editor doesn't have an indentation feature. It may be easier to write in Atom or vim, where you can easily indent lines or blocks. I'll look if Atom has a Markdown editor.

For a few words of code use &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt;.
